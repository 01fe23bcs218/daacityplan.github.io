            <h2>1. Transportation Network Company (TNC) / Uber</h2>
            <p><strong>Target 11.2:</strong> By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities, and older persons.</p>
            <p><strong>Indicator 11.2.1:</strong> Proportion of population that has convenient access to public transport, by sex, age, and persons with disabilities.</p>
            <h3>IN TNC: TO FIND SHORTEST PATH</h3>
            <p>When a passenger requests a ride, the system can use Dijkstra’s Algorithm to compute the shortest path from the passenger’s location to the nearest available driver and also to find the shortest path to the passenger's destination. This helps optimize the time taken to reach the passenger, ensuring a quicker and more efficient ride-matching process.</p>
            <p><strong>C++ implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm:</strong></p>
