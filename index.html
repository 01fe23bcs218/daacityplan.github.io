        <h2>Course Overview:</h2>
        <p>
            This course delves into the core concepts of algorithmic problem-solving and data organization. Beginning with the fundamentals, such as space and time complexity analysis, it progresses through advanced data structures like trees, graphs, and hash tables. Students learn how to employ these structures in tandem with algorithmic techniques, including recursion, backtracking, sorting, and searching, to address real-world challenges.
